<h1>The Jaccia and Jacciata Cellular Automata</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><dfn>Jaccia</dfn> and <dfn>Jacciata</dfn> are cellular automata inspired by the
<a class="external" href="http://www.riken.go.jp/lab-www/frontier-div/NEWSLETTER/feb2001/ameboid_e.htm">Announcement
of Scientific Proof that Slime Molds are Intelligent Maze Solvers</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the slime mold solves the maze by:</p>
<ul>
<li>initially being everywhere in the maze</li>
<li>there being food at the entrance and exit of the maze</li>
<li>minimizing its surface area by retreating from anywhere it can't get food.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jaccia operates the same way.  In the Jaccia automaton, slime cells survive if they have
immediate neighbours in at least two cardinal directions that provide sustenance, i.e. are
either food or other slime cells.  The result is the same: paths of slime cells that lead down
dead ends have one end which provides no sustenance and dies off.  Eventually, only paths
of slime cells that reach from food to food (or uninterrupted circular paths of slime cells)
remain.  Jacciata is a more involved automaton which finds only the shortest path.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>Jaccia has the property that, when started from this condition (entire maze filled
with slime cells), the automaton will eventually reach a fixed point (steady state) which
contains all possible paths from food to food.</p>

<p>Jacciata is similar, but has the property that when it reaches a fixed point, it will contain
the <em>shortest</em> path from food to food, if such a path exists and is unique.  If no
such path exists, or is not unique, the result is undefined.  It is otherwise similar to Jaccia.</p>

<p>The behaviour of both automata is also undefined if the slime configurations are not orthogonal
(that is, if there are any diagonal slime paths.)</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>Both Jaccia and Jacciata are defined in ALPACA v0.94.  Jaccia is defined in
the file <code>jaccia.alp</code> and Jacciata in <code>jacciata.alp</code>.
The ALPACA definition is authoritative; what is given here is merely advisory.</p>

<p>Both automata use basically the same set of symbols.  An initial Jaccia playfield
generally serves as an initial Jacciata playfield with the same kind of solution.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&nbsp;</code> - empty space</li>
<li><code>#</code> - wall (purely decorative)</li>
<li><code>%</code> - slime mold</li>
<li><code>F</code> - food</li>
<li><code>S</code> - "start" food (needed in Jacciata, optional in Jaccia)</li>
<li><code>-</code> - exploratory head (Jacciata only)</li>
<li><code>?</code> - exploratory body (Jacciata only)</li>
<li><code>@</code> - solved (Jacciata only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Jacciata's definition is not very elegant, especially when compared to Jaccia.  In order for it to work, the
two sources of food need to be labelled differently (S and F), there needs to be a "head" of
an exploratory shoot that looks for solutions, and so on.  It could probably be made more elegant with
some work.</p>

<p>The definition of these automata in ALPACA suggests some
possible improvements to that meta-language, particularly the definition of neighbourhoods
different from the assumed von Neumann neighbourhood, and their use in the count
operator.</p>

<p>Happy intelligence!  Such as it is.
